    note1 = "Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was first developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. Java has become one of the most popular programming languages due to its portability, ease of use, and robustness." + 
    '<h2>Key Features of Java:</h2>' + 
    '<p>1. Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA): One of the most notable features of Java is its platform independence. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means you can write code on one machine and run it on another, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.</p>' + 
    '2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is an object-oriented language, which means it is based on the concept of objects (instances of classes) and classes (blueprints for creating objects). The four fundamental principles of OOP are:'+

    'a.Encapsulation: Hiding internal object details and showing only essential features.<br>'+
   'b.Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones.<br>'+
   'c.Polymorphism: Using a single entity to represent different forms.<br>'+
   'd.Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.';
    notes2 = "Java development relies on a variety of tools that help developers write, compile, debug, and deploy their applications efficiently. These tools range from integrated development environments (IDEs) to build tools, version control systems, and deployment tools. Below is an overview of some commonly used tools in Java development";
